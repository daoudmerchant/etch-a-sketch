To build a 16x16 grid 'sketch pad' with various mouse-over effects

## Thoughts before beginning

Wow, this is going to take time. The resources clearly state that this is not going to be easy, and I can well believe it. I'm thankful at least for my previous HTML and CSS work so that I can spend more time getting over the (many) JavaScript hurdles. But I'm also excited, this feels at last like full manipulation of a webpage in a way I've never felt before. I'll be proud if at the end everything is functional, even though I anticipate a lingering feeling that I could have solved certain problems more efficiently.
